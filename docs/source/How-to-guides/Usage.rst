Usage
=======

To use the METOD algorithm in Python, ensure that all steps in the :ref:`Installation <installation>` process have been followed.

If the :ref:`Installation <installation>` of the METOD algorithm has been done correctly, all METOD algorithm source files can be imported. 

Python 
--------

In order to run the METOD algorithm from the command line, :ref:`Example 1 <ex1>` and :ref:`Example 2 <ex2>` can be modified to suit the user. Comments within metod_quad_example.py and metod_sog_example.py provide details on how to update the code.


Notebooks
----------

Similarly, :ref:`Jupyter notebooks <notebooks>` can also be modified to suit the user. Instructions within each notebook provide details on how to do this.
