Usage
=======

To use the METOD algorithm in Python, ensure that all steps in the :ref:`Installation <installation>` process have been followed.

If the :ref:`Installation <installation>` of the METOD algorithm is successful, all METOD algorithm source files can be imported. 

Quick Example using Python 
--------------------------------

See :ref:`Installation <installation>` for a quick example using the METOD algroithm.


Run examples using the command line
------------------------------------------------

In order to run the METOD algorithm from the command line, :ref:`Example 1 <ex1>` and :ref:`Example 2 <ex2>` can be modified to suit the user. Comments within :bash:`metod_quad_example.py` and :bash:`metod_sog_example.py` provide details on how to update the code.


Run examples using Jupyter Notebooks
---------------------------------------

Similarly, :ref:`Jupyter notebooks <notebooks>` can also be modified to suit the user. Instructions within each notebook provide details on how to do this.
