Usage
=======

To use the METOD Algorithm in Python, ensure that all steps in the :ref:`Installation <installation>` process have been followed.

If the :ref:`Installation <installation>` of the METOD Algorithm is successful, all METOD Algorithm source files can be imported. 

Quick example using Python 
--------------------------------

See :ref:`Installation <installation>` for a quick example using the METOD Algroithm.


Run examples using the command line
------------------------------------------------

In order to run the METOD Algorithm from the command line, :ref:`Example 1 <ex1>` and :ref:`Example 2 <ex2>` can be modified accordingly.
Comments within :bash:`metod_quad_example.py` and :bash:`metod_sog_example.py` provide details on how to update the code.


Run examples using Jupyter Notebooks
---------------------------------------

Similarly, :ref:`Jupyter Notebooks <notebooks>` can also be modified accordingly. Instructions within each Jupyter Notebook provide details on how to update the code.
