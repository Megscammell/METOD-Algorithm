Jupyter notebooks
======================

We can run :ref:`Example 1 <ex1>` and :ref:`Example 2 <ex2>` by using Jupyter notebooks:

* METOD Algorithm - Minimum of several quadratic forms.ipynb
* METOD Algorithm - Sum of Gaussians.ipynb

Notebooks can be found `here <https://github.com/Megscammell/METOD-Algorithm/tree/master/Examples/Notebooks>`_. Each Jupyter notebook contains inbuilt instructions on how to update parameters and how to run the METOD Algorithm. Similar to :ref:`Example 1 <ex1>` and :ref:`Example 2 <ex2>`, outputs will be stored within csv files.
