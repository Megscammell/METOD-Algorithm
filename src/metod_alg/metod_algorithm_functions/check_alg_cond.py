    Checks [1, Eq. 9] of the METOD algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    number_of_regions : integer
                        Total number of regions of attraction of local
                        minimizers identified.
    x_1 : 1-D array with shape (d, )
          Point with m-1 iterations of steepest descent.
    z_1 : 1-D array with shape (d, )
          Partner point associated with x_1.
    x_2 : 1-D array with shape (d, )
          Point with m iterations of steepest descent.
    z_2 : 1-D array with shape (d, )
          Partner point associated with x_2.
    x_points : list
               Each array within x_points contains
               steepest descent iterations for a point. The number of
               points in which local descent has been applied is the same
               as number_of_regions.
    z_points : list
               Partner points for each array in x_points.
    m : integer
        Number of iterations of steepest descent to apply to point
        before making decision on terminating descents.
    d : integer
        Size of dimension.
    no_inequals_to_compare : string
                             The number of inequalities to compute and
                             compare.

    Returns
    -------
    possible_region_numbers : list
                              Contains the region of
                              attraction number, where
                              the METOD algorithm condition holds.
