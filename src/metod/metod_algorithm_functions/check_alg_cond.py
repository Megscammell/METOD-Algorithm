    Parameters
    ----------
    number_of_regions : integer
                        Number of regions of attraction of local minimizers
                        identified.
    x_1 : 1-D array with shape (d, )
        Point with m-1 iterations of steepest descent.
    z_1 : 1-D array with shape (d, )
        Partner point associated with x_1.
    x_2 : 1-D array with shape (d, )
        Point with m iterations of steepest descent.
    z_2 : 1-D array with shape (d, )
        Partner point associated with x_2.
    x_points : list
                Each array within x_points are steepest descent
                iterations that have been continued until
                g(x, *func_args) is smaller than some tolerance, where
                x is a 1-D array with shape (d, ).
    z_points : list
                Each array within z_points are corresponding partner
                points for each array in x_points.
    m : integer
        Number of iterations of steepest descent to apply to point
        before making decision on terminating descents.
    d : integer
        Size of dimension.

    Returns
    -------
    possible_region_numbers : list
                                Contains the indices of the regions of
                                attraction of local minimizers, where
                                the METOD algorithm condition holds.
