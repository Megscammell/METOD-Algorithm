    """Apply steepest descent iterations until the euclidean
    norm of the gradient is smaller than tolerance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    point : 1-D array with shape (d, )
            A point to apply steepest descent iterations.
    d : integer
        Size of dimension.
    projection : boolean
                 If projection is True, this projects points back to
                 (bound_1, bound_2). If projection is False, points are
                 kept the same.
    tolerance : integer or float (optional)
                Stopping condition for steepest descent iterations.
                Can either apply steepest descent iterations until the norm of
                g(point, *func_args) is less than some tolerance (usage =
                metod_algorithm) or until the total number of steepest descent
                iterations is greater than some tolerance  (usage =
                metod_analysis)
    tolerance : float
                Stopping condition for steepest descent iterations.
    option : string
             Choose from 'minimize' or 'minimize_scalar'. For more
             information about each option see
             https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html.
    met : string
         Choose method for option. For more information see
         - https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/
         scipy.optimize.minimize.html#scipy.optimize.minimize
         - https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/
         scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar.html#scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar
    initial_guess : float or integer
                    Initial guess passed to scipy.optimize.minimize. This
                    is recommended to be small.
    func_args : tuple
                Arguments passed to f and g.
    f : objective function.

        ``f(point, *func_args) -> float``

        where ``point`` is a 1-D array with shape(d, ) and func_args is
        a tuple of arguments needed to compute the function value.
    g : gradient of objective function.

       ``g(point, *func_args) -> 1-D array with shape (d, )``

        where ``point`` is a 1-D array with shape (d, ) and func_args is
        a tuple of arguments needed to compute the gradient.
    bounds_1 : integer
               Lower bound used for projection.
    bounds_2 : integer
               Upper bound used for projection.
    usage : string
            Used to decide stopping criterion for steepest descent
            iterations. Should be either usage == 'metod_algorithm' or
            usage == 'metod_analysis'.
    relax_sd_it : float or integer
                  Small constant in [0, 2] to multiply the step size by for a
                  steepest descent iteration. This process is known as relaxed
                  steepest descent [1].


    Returns
    -------
    sd_iterations : 2-D array with shape (its, d)
                    Each row of sd_iterations contains a new point
                    after a steepest descent iteration.
    its: integer
         Total number of steepest descent iterations.
